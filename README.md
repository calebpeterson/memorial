Localhost tracking of metrics from the command line.

> I keep running that command to find remaining files to change; how much progress have I made?

Ever wanted to keep track of how something has changed while you're working on it locally?

## Usage

`<some command that outputs files/lines/etc... that still need to be changed> | memorial --lines --print`

Gives you the command's output followed by:

```
original command output
...

Latest measurement: 26 lines

      26.00 â”¼    â•­
      22.75 â”¤â•­â”€â”€â•®â”‚
      19.50 â”¤â”‚  â”‚â”‚
      16.25 â”¤â”‚  â”‚â”‚
      13.00 â”¤â”‚  â•°â•¯
       9.75 â”¼â•¯
       6.50 â”¤
       3.25 â”¤
       0.00 â”¤
```

Do more work, run the command again and see the trend:

```

### Print

Show the current trendline at any time:

```
> memorial --print
```

Can be coupled with `--lines` to count the number of lines read on STDIN and then show the trendline when the input stream terminates.

### Purge

Purge all measurements and start with a blank slate:

```
> memorial --purge
```

## Measurement schemes

`memorial` can gather the measurement to track by:

### Counting lines (`--lines`)

The `--lines` mode will simply count the number of lines of input passed to `memorial` on STDIN and consider the total for a given invocation to be the measurement to store.

When to use:

- using `grep` (or similar) to find all occurrences of the metric to measure
